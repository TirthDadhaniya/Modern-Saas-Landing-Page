# AI Usage Report - ADmyBRAND Landing Page Project

## **AI Tools Used**

### **Primary Tools**

- **0v.dev** – Generated the initial UI components for the website.
- **ChatGPT** – Refined and modified the UI, implemented interactive features, and improved visual effects (e.g., smooth transitions, navbar integration).
- **Cursor IDE** – Assisted with in-editor AI suggestions to speed up coding and integration.
- **Gemini (Image Generation)** – Created the favicon and other small graphic assets.

### **Key Use Cases**

- Generating structured sections (Hero, Features, Pricing, Testimonials, FAQ, Footer).
- Implementing animations using Framer Motion.
- Adding glassmorphism, radial glows, and gradient depth effects.
- Achieving smooth color transitions between sections for seamless visuals.
- Placing and styling the navbar inside the Hero section.
- Creating reusable components (Button, Card, Accordion, Carousel).

## **Sample Prompts (2-3 Examples)**

### **Prompt 1: Hero Section Creation**

_"Create a Hero section in Next.js + Tailwind with glassmorphism, a big headline, subtext, CTA button, and hero illustration. Make it responsive and add Framer Motion fade-in animations."_

### **Prompt 2: Navbar Integration**

_"Place the navbar inside the Hero section without changing existing Hero spacing or colors, and make the navbar background transparent."_

### **Prompt 3: Smooth Section Transitions**

_"Smoothly transition background colors between all sections so there's no visible block separation, using gradients that match my purple/blue theme."_

## **AI vs Manual Work Split**

### **AI-Generated (80%)**

- Section structures (Hero, Features, Pricing, Testimonials, FAQ, Footer).
- Reusable components and animations (Button, Card, Modal, Accordion, Carousel).
- Initial layout with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

### **Manual Coding (20%)**

- Adjusted background gradients and added radial glows for depth.
- Centered and aligned fonts for better visual hierarchy.
- Created smooth color transitions between sections using overlays.
- Integrated favicon and small graphic tweaks from Gemini-generated images.

### **Customization**

- Combined AI-generated components into a cohesive structure.
- Tweaked animations, hover effects, and glassmorphism overlays to match the project's brand style.
- Used Cursor IDE to test, refactor, and improve consistency across sections.
